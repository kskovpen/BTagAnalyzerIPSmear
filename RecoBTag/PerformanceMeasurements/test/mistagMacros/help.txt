## Mistag measurement: 
######################

Detailed explanations are given in CMS PAS BTV-07-002.
The following quantities have to be computed:
 - Negative Tag rate for Data and for Monte Carlo (NegTag_Data and NegTag_MC)
 - Positive Tag rate for light jets in Monte Carlo (Mistag_MC)
 - Rlight = Mistag_MC / NegTag_MC

Then the Mistag rate in Data is: Mistag_Data = Rlight * NegTag_Data

One can also define a scale factor to be applied to the Mistag rate in MC:
           SF_Mistag = NegTag_Data / NegTag_MC 
and thus Mistag_Data = SF_Mistag * Mistag_MC 
 
## Work Flow: 
#############  

Step 1: Ntuples are produced via Crab with MistagAnalyzer.cc (in CMSSW).

Step 2: The following program (JetsAna) runs on these Ntuples and produces 
        histograms in a root file.

Step 3: Dedicated macros analyse these histograms in order to get relevant
        quantities in an ASCII file to be converted in the Data Base:
 - for Data : NegTag_Data with its statistical error
 - for MC :   NegTag_MC and Mistag_MC with their statistical errors
              and Rlight with its statistical+systematic uncertainty
	    
## Step 2:
##########

Root -x JetsAna_Run.C -q 
will read a list of Ntuples (to be defined in JetsAna_Run.C), 
loop on them by calling JetsAna.C where root histograms will be filled in the
output directory.

Some title cards can be set in JetsAna_Run.C, which also allows to read the same
Ntuples several times in a single pass (with different output Root files at each
pass):
 t->Loop(NN,TagCut,PtMin,PtMax,EtaMin,EtaMax,FreeCut,IntCut,"filename");
with 
 - NN: the chosen tagging algorithm 
       0 = Jet Probability (JP), 
       1 = Jet BProbability (JBP),
       2 = Track Counting High Efficiency (TCHE), 
       3 = Track Counting High Purity (TCHP), 
       4 = Simple Secondary Vertex High Efficiency (SSVHE), 
       5 = Simple Secondary Vertex High Purity (SSVHP), 
       6 = Combined Secondary Vertex (CSV), 
       7 = Soft Muon with PtRel, 
       8 = Track Counting with first track
 - TagCut: the cut on the tagging discriminant for a given operating point
 - PtMin, PtMax: the considered jet Pt range 
 - EtaMin, EtaMax: the considered jet Eta range
 - FreeCut: a free variable for some further selection cut 
 - IntCut: another free variable for the HLT bit selection 
 - filename: the output root file 
   Caution : please choose different names for different values of the previous 
             variables and also for different input Ntuples !
    
## Step 3:
##########
 - Edit the file /macro/plot2_mistag_pt.C
 - Specify the names of the Data and MC root files 
   f0 (Data), f1 (primary MC), f2 (MC with TrackHistory information)
 - Specify the eta range: EtaMin and EtaMax.
   By default, the pt binning is that from the Root files.
 - Root 
   then .L plot2_mistag_pt.C
   then plot()
   -> Gives, vs jet pt, the mistag estimate in Data and the Data/MC scale factor
      with their total stat+syst error.
      The results are displayed as plots and as an ASCII file (Mistag_pt.txt).
      The plots show the central value (solid curve) with their +- 1 sigma error
      (dotted curve)
      For MC, the mistag plot also shows the MC truth information.
    then .q
 - Save the Mistag_pt.txt output file under another name and repeat the previous
   operation for other selections (eta range, operating point, taggers, etc...)
   in order to complete the requested ASCII files
