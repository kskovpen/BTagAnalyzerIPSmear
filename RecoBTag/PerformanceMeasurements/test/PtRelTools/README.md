# PtRelAnalyzer
/*************************************************************************************************************************

This tool has been developed to measure the efficiency of the b-tagging algorithms with the PtRel and System8 methods.
The tool is based on the BTagAnalyzer trees ( https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/BTagAnalyzer ), whose central
production for performance measurements is summarized in https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/BTagAnalyzer .

A detailed description of the PtRel and System8 methods and their implementation in the PtRelAnalyzer package can be found
in the following twikis: 
 - PtRel: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/BTagPerformancePtRel (in construction)
 - System8: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/BTagPerformanceS8Tree (obsolete)
